#    - Set to 644
#
# 2. The PHP path might be different on your hosting.
#    Common PHP paths in cPanel:
#    - /usr/local/bin/php
#    - /usr/bin/php
#    - /opt/cpanel/ea-php74/root/usr/bin/php (for EA-PHP)
#    Ask your hosting provider for the correct path if unsure
#
# 3. Check the cron_test_log file in the same directory as test_cron_email.php
#    for any error messages or successful execution logs
#
# 4. This test script will:
#    - Check for today's appointments (without time restriction)
#    - Check for tomorrow's appointments
#    - Send test emails to actual users with appointments
#    - Add [TEST] prefix to all subjects and messages
#    - Log all actions with [TEST] prefix
#
# 5. IMPORTANT: This is for testing only. 
#    Remove this cron job after testing is complete to avoid:
#    - Sending too many test emails
#    - Unnecessary server load
#    - Confusion for users
#
# 6. To remove the cron job after testing:
#    - Go back to cPanel > Cron Jobs
#    - Find this cron job
#    - Click "Delete" or remove the line from the crontab
